                <h2>About me</h2>
                
                <p>Hello everyone I am a student currently studying front-end engineering through codecademy. I have been working in IT from 2008 and have only recently
                    made the jump to software development. As you can clearly see I still have a lot to learn, as pointed out by the weird font that I am using.
                    As with all skills, it takes time and practise to perfect.
                    I will then hence forth use the 5 P's principle, Practise Prevents Piss Poor Performance.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>If you have found this page through a recruitment oppertunity or through my resume, welcome and sorry. This will get better with time I promise.
                    All that I can do now is make a commitment to improve as time goes by.
                    You might have also noticed that I have added a picture of a cute koala instead of my own picture, and the reason for this is, I don't want to overwhelm
                    you with this pretty face, the coding alone can do the job.
                </p>
                <br>
                    <p>To demonstrate my javascript skills, I will add two buttons, one for a random password generator, and the other for a modal pop up to view my contact info</p>
                    <button onclick="generate()">Password generator</button>
                    <button id="openModal">Contact Info</button>

                        <div id="myModal" class="modal">
                            <div class="modal-content">
                            <span class="close">&times;</span>
                            <h2>Contact Information</h2>
                            <p>Name: Chris van der Linde</p>
